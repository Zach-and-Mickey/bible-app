  <h1>About my website</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my site. I know there are many other Bible websites out there. This is a bit of a passion project for me. I taught myself some simple web development skills and at first I was making random things to play around with, but I wanted to do something more useful. I decided to start on a Bible App. The difference between this site and many other Bible sites is that I am constantly trying to improve it. If you have an idea for a feature, let me know on the github repository and I will see what I can do.</p>
