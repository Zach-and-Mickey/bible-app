  <h1>About my website</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my site. I know there are many other Bible websites out there. This is a bit of a passion project for me. I taught myself some simple web development skills and at first I was making random things to play around with, but I wanted to do something more useful. I decided to start on a Bible App. The difference between this site and many other Bible sites is that I am constantly trying to improve it. If you have an idea for a feature, let me know on the github repository and I will see what I can do.</p>

    // Get all links in the navigation menu
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('a');

    // Loop through each link and check if the href matches the current page URL
    links.forEach(link => {
        if (link.href === window.location.href) {
            link.classList.add('active'); // Add the 'active' class to the current page link
        } else {
            link.classList.remove('active'); // Remove the 'active' class from other links
        }
    });
