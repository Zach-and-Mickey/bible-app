Something I'm working on right now. Hopefully it will be useful.

## Future Things
 - Next and Previous chapter buttons on main reader.
 - Daily Reading: Daily Reading Plan following my pastor's reading plan. Three chapters a day Monday-Saturday, 5 on Sunday.
 - More Translations: Hopefully the people I am pulling data from add more translations. They have stated that they will and I am watching closely.
 - I would like to add Spanish to the Multiverse so that people who are trying to learn Spanish can practice by reading the English right next to the Spanish.
 - Discussion Space: I would love to have a discussion space where people can ask questions or post their thoughts about particular verses but I am not sure if that is even possible on Github. I will look into it.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions by opening an issue. Also feel free to use any of my code.
