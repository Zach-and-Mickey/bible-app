Something I'm working on right now. Hopefully it will be useful.

## Future Things
 - The Multiverse: You will be able to select up to three translations and view them side by side for comparison.
 - More Translations: Hopefully the people I am pulling data from add more translations. They have stated that they will and I am watching closely.
 - Blog: I'm currently trying to figure out a blog in another repository, but I might move it to this one and have it as a feature.
 - Discussion Space: I would love to have a discussion space where people can ask questions or post their thoughts about particular verses but I am not sure if that is even possible on Github. I will look into it.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions by opening an issue. Also feel free to use any of my code.
